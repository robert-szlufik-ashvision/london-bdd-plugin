# Session State — `.bdd/session.yml`

Every command reads this file first and updates it last. It is the single
source of truth for where we are in the workflow. It lives in the project
root under `.bdd/` and is committed to `feature/<slice>-tmp` (it documents
the slice), but excluded from the squash onto `feature/<slice>-main`.

If the file is missing, no slice is active — only `/scenario` or
`/refactor-scope` may create it.

## Schema

```yaml
# .bdd/session.yml
slice: place-order                  # kebab-case slice name
mode: GREENFIELD                    # GREENFIELD | SAFE | FULL_REFACTOR
phase: inner                        # scope | characterise | scenario |
                                    # decompose | inner | close | done
autonomy: auto                      # supervised | auto — set by the
                                    # developer when the slice is opened
handback: null                      # auto only: why the agent stopped
                                    # and handed the slice back
branch: feature/place-order-tmp     # expected working branch
base_branch: feature/place-order-main

# SAFE / FULL_REFACTOR — the outer net. The NET is the license to change
# code; characterisation is only one way to build one. If the scope is
# already covered by trusted behavioural tests (e.g. code built through
# the double loop), the human declares them the net at /refactor-scope
# and /characterise is skipped entirely.

                                    # (characterisation kind only)

  scope: cycle-3                    # cycle-<n> (per /inner) | slice (/review)
  blocking: 0                       # open [block] findings; must be 0 to commit

```

`/commit-merge --auto` authorizes its squash-merge through a *separate*,
untracked `.bdd/.merge-authorized` marker file — never a session.yml
field. `git checkout feature/<slice>-main` removes session.yml from the
working tree (it's tracked only on the tmp branch), so nothing in
session.yml can carry state across that checkout. See `/commit-merge` and
`scripts/guard.py` for the marker's exact format and lifecycle.

## Field rules

- `autonomy` is the developer's call, made once when the slice is opened
  (`/scenario` or `/refactor-scope`). Absent means `supervised`. The agent
  can never promote a slice to `auto` — hook-enforced — but can always
  hand it back: set `autonomy: supervised` plus a one-line `handback:`
  reason. `/status` then names the developer as next. The developer
  clears `handback` (and may re-set `auto`) to resume.
- Under `autonomy: auto`, `mode`, `scope.in`/`scope.out` and `net.kind`
  are frozen for the agent (hook Rule D). `review` gates every cycle
  commit and the move to `done` (hook Rules C and D): its `scope` must
  name exactly the cycle being committed (`cycle-<n>`, the already
  incremented `cycle`) or `slice`, with `blocking: 0`.

- `current_failing_test` is set by `/unit` (or `/acceptance` for the outer
  red) and cleared by the commit step at the end of the cycle. The
  production-edit hook keys off this field.
- `scope.in` / `scope.out` use glob patterns relative to project root.
  The scope hook keys off these in SAFE and FULL_REFACTOR modes.
- `net.kind: existing` records the human's declaration (made at
  `/refactor-scope`, after a real green run) that the scope is already
  covered by trusted suites. `net.kind: characterisation` means
  `/characterise` built the net. The guard checks `net.status` only —
  the kind is a recorded human judgment, never re-derived. A legacy
  `characterisation:` block (pre-`net:` schema) is still honoured by
  the guard as a characterisation-kind net.
- `phase` transitions are forward-only within a slice:
  `scope → characterise → scenario → decompose → inner → close → done`
  (GREENFIELD skips scope/characterise; SAFE/FULL_REFACTOR skips
  characterise when the net is a declared existing suite). Commands
  refuse to run out of
  order and say which command is expected next. `done` is terminal for the
  slice; `/commit-merge` is the only command that still acts on it.
  This is hook-enforced, not just documented: `scripts/guard.py`'s Rule D
  validates the target phase on every edit to session.yml — it blocks
  backward moves and moves into a phase whose precondition isn't actually
  met yet (e.g. `close` requires every collaborator `done`), so a step
  can't be skipped by writing the field directly.
- Don't re-derive "what's next" by exploring the repo — it's a lookup,
  not a judgment call. Run `/status` (`scripts/next.py`), which parses
  this file the same way the guard hook does.
- One slice per session file. New slice = archive old file to
  `.bdd/archive/<slice>.yml`, create fresh.
